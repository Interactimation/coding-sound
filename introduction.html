  <h1>Introduction to Coding Sound</h1>
  <p>
    People have been making <a href="https://www.nms.si/en/collections/highlights/343-Neanderthal-flute">artificial
      (non-vocal) sounds for a long
      time</a> —watch the video to hear a
    replicated Neanderthal flute being played!
  </p>
  <p>
    How does the Neanderthal flute produce these variations in sound? It has to do with how <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdKa5Mwd3fU">breath oscillates within a
      cylinder</a>
      </p>
      <p>
      In fact all sounds are based on oscillations and the physics
    of these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOQ1XiDhqkE">can be complex</a>
</p>

  <h2>
    Chaos and Complexity, Resolved
  </h2>
  <p>
    Even though there are chaotic elements in sound production we can understand what's going on at a high degree of
    fineness when, for instance:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Air <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ9tqArL-6o>oscillates in a cylinder</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      A <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X72on6CSL0>string is plucked</a> OR
    </li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Or it's <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnH2ltfW48U>vibrated at different frequencies</a>
      </li>
      <li>A guitar is <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOCGb5ZGEV8>strummed with open strings</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <li>
      Or when a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR_XL192wXw>membrain (like a drum head) vibrates</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Overtones
  </h3>
  <p>
    In the example of the string being <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnH2ltfW48U>vibrated by an oscillator</a>
    we found that particular setup had a "first mode of vibration" at 11 Hz (11 cycles per second) and that at multiples
    of this "fundamental" a series of "harmonics" could be discovered where the vibratory sections divided and divided,
    separated by nodes of (relative) stillness
  </p>
  <blockquote>NOTE: It's worth considering that 11 Hz is far to low for human hearing, which ranges somewhere between 20
    Hz and 20,000 Hz (or 20 kHz) —with a lot of variation among individuals, <a
      href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM4WSBZanQQ>especially by age</a>
    <br />
    <b>Be sure your volume is turned down by at least 1/4 when running this test!</b>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Sounds produced by physical oscillations are "dirty", containing much more sonic information than the fundamental
    "tone" or "pitch"
  </p>

  <p>
    Specifically, we'll be coding sound for the web<br />
    <br />
    The course makes use of <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/" target="_blank">Tone.js</a>, a javascript library for
    addressing the Web Audio API, which can be addressed directly in vanilla javascript<br />
    <br />
    What Tone.js offers is <i>structure</i> —specifically it offers common DAW (digital audio workstation) features like
    prebuilt synths, effects and other building blocks to create your audio projects<br />
    <br />
    Your projects will become web pages, hosted through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#GitHub_Pages"
      target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> —much like this textbook— and become a digital portfolio of sound design you can
    share with me or anyone!<br />
    <br />

  <h2>Structure</h2>
  The course is divided into three sections:
  <ul>
    <li>Synthesis: Making sounds from pure code</li>
    <li>Sound files: Playback, Filtering, Alteration of existing audio clips</li>
    <li>Spatialization: Moving sounds around in 3D space</li>
  </ul>

  We'll be creating playable instruments, generative soundscapes and interactive environments<br />
